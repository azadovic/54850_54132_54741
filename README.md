# Energy Consumption Calculator

## Description
This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for calculating the energy consumption of a house per square meter per year. It takes various parameters such as house area, number of occupants, heating power, appliances energy consumption, insulation quality, window area, window type, external temperature, renewable energy sources, and wall insulation factor into account for the calculation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Python's standard GUI toolkit)

## Usage
1. Run `54850_54132_54741.exe`.
2. Enter the required parameters in the GUI:
    - Area of the house (in square meters)
    - Number of occupants
    - Heating power (in kW)
    - Appliances energy consumption (in kWh/day)
    - Insulation quality (coefficient)
    - Windows area (in square meters)
    - Window type ('single' or 'double')
    - External temperature (in Celsius)
    - Renewable energy sources (in kWh/year)
    - Wall insulation factor (0-1)
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. The calculated energy consumption per square meter per year will be displayed.

## Notes
- Ensure all input parameters are numeric values. Non-numeric inputs will result in an error message
